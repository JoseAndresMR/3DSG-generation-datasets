# 3DSG-generation-datasets
Suit of 3D Scene Graph datasets for graph generation conditioned on plane information. Layouts built from three sources: Syntetic data (S), MSD public dataset  (M) and real LIDAR information (R). Incremental complexity with hierarchy: walls, rooms, floors, buildings and city. The .zip files can be found in the datasets files, divided by source and hierarchy level (-F= up to floor level, -B= up to building level, -C= up to city level). Each .zip file contains an array of NetworkX graphs.
